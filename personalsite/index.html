      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        Hello, and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Ricardo Coronel, and I'm a new front-end developer specializing in HTML and CSS. I'm currently studying at Brigham Young University, where I'm learning everything I can about web design and development
      </p>
      <p>I've always been passionate about design, and I knew early on that I wanted to pursue a career in this field. I started learning about HTML and CSS on my own, and I quickly realized that web development was the perfect combination of creativity and technical skills. I love being able to take an idea and turn it into a beautiful, functional website that people can use and enjoy.</p>
      <p>During my time at BYU, I've had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects that have helped me hone my skills as a designer and developer. I've learned how to create responsive layouts that look great on any device, how to optimize images and other assets for the web, and how to use HTML and CSS to create dynamic, interactive websites.</p>
      <p>One of the things I'm most proud of is the work I've done on [insert project name]. This was a challenging project that required me to push my skills to the limit, but I was able to deliver a beautiful, user-friendly website that exceeded my client's expectations.</p>
      <p>In addition to my technical skills, I'm also a creative problem solver. I love tackling complex challenges and coming up with elegant solutions that are both functional and beautiful. Whether I'm working on a new design concept or debugging a tricky piece of code, I always approach my work with enthusiasm and a commitment to excellence.</p>
      <p>When I'm not working on web development projects, you can usually find me you can usually find me exploring the great outdoors. I'm also a first-generation college student, and I believe that my diverse experiences have given me a unique perspective that I can bring to my work as a designer and developer.</p>
      <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I'm excited to share my work with you and to help you create beautiful, effective websites that meet your needs and exceed your expectations. If you have any questions or would like to discuss a project, please don't hesitate to get in touch!</p>
